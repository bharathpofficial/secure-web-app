It's an excellent idea to expand your code. Here are some suggestions for expanding your project:

Implement user authentication and authorization to track who is making the inputs.

Create a dashboard to visualize the logged data, showing trends in SQL injection attempts.

Expand the threat detection to cover other types of attacks, like XSS or CSRF.

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the input system.

Add more detailed logging, including request headers and timestamps.

Create an API endpoint to allow programmatic access to the logged data.

Implement real-time notifications for detected threats.

Add a machine learning component to improve threat detection over time.

Implement a quarantine system for suspicious inputs.

Create a reporting system to generate periodic security reports.

These expansions will significantly enhance the functionality and security of your application. Let me know which areas you'd like to focus on, and I can provide more detailed guidance.
